  abstract = {Deep-learning accelerators are increasingly popular. There are two prevalent accelerator architectures: one based on general matrix multiplication units and the other on convolution cores. However, Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM), a widely used deep-learning compiler stack, does not support the latter. This paper proposes a general framework for extending TVM to support deep-learning accelerators with convolution cores. We have applied it to two well-known accelerators: Nvidia's NVDLA and Bitmain's BM1880 successfully. Deep-learning workloads can now be readily deployed to these accelerators through TVM and executed efficiently. This framework can extend TVM to other accelerators with minimum effort.},

However, the freedom in the solution design space of FPGAs represents a problem because each solution must be individually designed, verified, and tuned. The emergence of High Level Synthesis (HLS) helps solving this problem and has allowed the implementation of open programming standards as OpenVX for computer vision applications on FPGAs, such as the HiFlipVX library developed exclusively for Xilinx devices. Although with the HiFlipVX library, designers can develop solutions efficiently on Xilinx, they do not have an approach to port and run their code on FPGAs from other manufacturers.},
